What are loops?

Iterable object?


for loops:
~~~~~~~~~~
1. collection of data like string,list of data
2. for ever number in the list, for every letter in the string
3. syntax :
    **for** item **in** iterable_object
        # do something with the data

4. Example :
    for char in "hello""
        print(char)
5. ranges are used with for loops. Rangesare a part of random and are used to generate random numbers between the specified range.
    >>range:
    range(7) - give numbers from 0 -6
    range(1,7) - gives numbers from 1 to 7
    range(1,8,2) - gives numbers from 1 to 8 but skips by 2. i.e. 1,3,5,7
    range(7,0,-1) - gives numbers from 7 to 0 in reverse order. i.e. 7,6,5,4,3,2,1
while loops:
